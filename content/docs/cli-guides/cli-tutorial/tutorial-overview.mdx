description: What is a semi-normal CLI based workflow with GitButler
---

Using the GitButler CLI is meant to make a specific common workflow very simple, which is roughly:

- Create a branch
- Do work on that branch
- Commit to that branch
- Optionally, create another branch if you find unrelated work you need to do
- Work on and commit to that branch
- Submit a branch for review
- Create a stacked branch if needed to continue on dependent work
- Update your base if work has been integrated to remove merged work
- Rinse and repeat

Additionally, GitButler is very good at editing commits (amending fixup work, squashing, rewording messages, etc), it keeps a simple log of what you've done in case you need to go back in time, it makes collaborating on a branch with others easy, it has great GitHub/Lab integration and more.

Let's walk through some of the things it can do and what a typical day using the GitButler CLI might look like.
