The target branch is the foundation that your feature branches build upon. Keeping it updated and managing it properly is crucial for a smooth workflow.

## Understanding the Target Branch

The target branch is typically your main production branch that acts as the basis for all your local branches.

In practice, this is generally not actually a local branch, it's usually the branch on whatever server you're using to collaborate and merge changes into, so generally it's something like `origin/main` or `origin/master`.

When GitButler is first initialized in a project, you are asked to choose a branch to target, as everything in your working directory that doesn't exactly match the tip of this branch is technically a fork of what is considered production. Whatever that target branch looks like when you choose it is set as your 'base'.

You can always check your target branch setting with `but config`:

```cli [updating-the-base-but-config-1, 484px]
but config
```

Or get more information with `but config target`:

```cli [updating-the-base-but-config-2, 330px]
but config target
```

When you start working, everything that is different from that base goes into a branch based off of it.

## Understanding Upstream

When you first set your target branch (ie, `origin/main`), we record the state of the branch at that time.

However, if someone else merges work into that branch while you're working, the target branch moves forward, but the work you're doing is still based off of where it was. We call this 'upstream' work, and the commit that the target _was_ pointing at and your branches were based off of is your "base".

The problem is that now the stuff we're working on is out of date. It may conflict with what is upstream, it may need the work that is upstream, etc. So how do we get our branch up to date?

## Viewing Upstream

When you run `but status`, we will by default show you a summary of upstream work if there is any. You can see a more detailed list of what is upstream by `but status --upstream` (or `-u`).

{/* restore [cc9d20b8099c] */}
{/* run git push -f origin 32a2175758f7f649ed7a030a17fd21213a5e400f:refs/heads/main */}

Let's take a look at what this looks like. Let's say that our project is at this state:

```cli [updating-the-base-but-status-1, 396px]
but status -u
```

We can see that there are two commits upstream (ie, merged into `origin/main` since we started our branch).

Technically, there could be more reachable commits, but we only show the first parents, so merges of long branches show up as just the merge commits, to simplify things a bit.

Now let's say that we would like to pull in the upstream work and rebase our branches on top of the new upstream to update them. We can check what all would happen with `but pull --check`.

```cli [updating-the-base-but-pull-1, 330px]
but pull --check
```

This will fetch the very latest work, then check that upstream work against your currently applied branches to see if anything has been integrated (and thus we can remove), anything conflicts with upstream work, or a merge/rebase should work cleanly.

In this example, we can see that our `user-bookmarks` branch would be cleanly rebased if we did a pull, and that there are two things that have been merged since we started our branches.

## Updating the Base

When you feel like you want to get your active branches up to date, you can run `but pull`. This will fetch the very latest work, then rebase your active branches on top of the new target commit to be your new base.

Let's run it in our example.

```cli [updating-the-base-but-pull-2, 418px]
but pull
```

```cli [updating-the-base-but-status-2, 308px]
but status
```

OK, now we can see that our integrated branch was removed, our `gemfile-fixes` branch was successfully rebased and our `sc-branch-26` work is marked as conflicted. We'll see how to deal with that state in a minute.
