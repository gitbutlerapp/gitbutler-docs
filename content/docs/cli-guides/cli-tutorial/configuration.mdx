description: How to customize your GitButler CLI experience

We've already covered `but config` a bit in dealing with forges and target branches.

You can also use it for some basic user configuration, such as setting your name and email address for commits and your default editor.

```cli [configuration-but-config-1, 286px]
but config user
```

## Aliases

GitButler also has a built in aliasing system in case you want to provide some shorthands.

```cli [configuration-but-alias-1, 286px]
but alias
```

To add a new alias, you can run `but alias add <alias> <expansion>`, which you can also provide a `-g` or `--global` if you want it to be a global alias. This will put this data in your local or global Git config file.

You will notice that there is a `default` alias, which is what runs when you just run `but` with no arguments. If you overwrite the `default` alias, you can set up something other than `status` to run by default.
