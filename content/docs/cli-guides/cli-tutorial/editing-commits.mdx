While you can rub changes in and out of commits, you can also edit the commit
message of any commit in your workspace quite easily.

## Editing Commit Messages

You can edit commit messages with the `but describe` command. So if we have this status:

{/* restore [d69fffa7c6eb] */}

```cli [8e0965d4ad557bc8, 242px]
but status
```

Then you can edit the message of any commit by running `but describe <sha>`, which will open up your editor of choice with the existing commit message and when you exit the editor, replace that message in the commit and rebase everything above it.

The editor would look something like this:

```
add user changes

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Changes in this commit:
#       modified:   app/models/user.rb
#       modified:   config/routes.rb
#
~
~
~
~
```

Pretty simple.
