If you're using AI agent tools like Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Code, GitButler can enhance your coding experience by managing commits, saving points, and more. These integrations allow you to focus on coding with your agents while GitButler handles the version control aspects.

There are currently two main ways to integrate AI tools with GitButler:

1. **Using the MCP Server**: This method allows you to set up your AI agent to communicate with GitButler's MCP server, enabling features like automatic commits and save points.
2. **Using the Hooks in Claude Code**: This method allows you to use GitButler's hooks to manage commits and branches directly from within the Claude Code environment.

## Enabling the experimental feature flag

Note that as of GitButler version `0.15.2` these features have to be enabled via an experimental feature flag. You can find that under `Global Settings` -> `Experimental` -> `GitButler Actions`.
