title: Moving Branches Between Stacks
description: Learn how to reorganize your branches by moving them between different stacks
---

## Overview

GitButler allows you to move branches between stacks through a simple drag-and-drop interface. This is useful when you want to reorganize your work, change branch dependencies, or consolidate related branches into a single stack.

## Moving a Branch to Another Stack

You can move a branch from one stack to another by dragging it to a specific position in the target stack.

### How to Move a Branch

1. **Drag the branch header** - Click and hold on the branch header (the section displaying the branch name)
2. **Drop on target location** - Drag it to the position where you want to insert it in another stack

When you hover over a valid drop target during the drag operation, you'll see visual indicators showing where the branch will be placed.

### Drop Zones

There are two types of drop zones when moving branches:

- **Between branches** - Drop the branch between two existing branches in a stack to insert it at that position
- **Top of stack** - Drop at the top of a stack to make the moved branch the first branch

The drop zones appear as horizontal lines with visual feedback when you hover over them during a drag operation.

## Creating a New Stack (Tearing Off)

You can also separate a branch from its current stack and create a new independent stack for it. This is called "tearing off" a branch.

### How to Tear Off a Branch

1. **Drag the branch header** - Click and hold on the branch header you want to separate
2. **Drop outside the stacks area** - Drag it to the designated dropzone outside of the existing stacks

This creates a new standalone stack containing just that branch.

## Important Considerations

### Branch Requirements

Not all branches can be moved. A branch must meet these conditions to be movable:

- **No conflicts** - The branch must not have any merge conflicts
- **Has commits** - The branch must contain at least one commit
- **Different target stack** - You can only move branches to different stacks (not within the same stack)

### What Happens During a Move

When you move a branch:

1. **Branch is extracted** - The branch and its commits are extracted from the source stack
2. **Rebasing occurs** - The branch is rebased onto the new base in the target stack
3. **References updated** - Git references are updated to reflect the new structure
4. **Stack cleanup** - If the moved branch was the last one in its stack, that stack is deleted

### Pull Request Updates

If you're using GitHub integration and the branch has an associated pull request:

- **PR descriptions are automatically updated** - The PR base and description are updated to reflect the new stack structure
- **Stack PRs are synchronized** - All PRs in both the source and target stacks have their descriptions updated to maintain proper stacking information
