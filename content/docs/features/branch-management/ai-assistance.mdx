description: Let AI handle the busywork — generate branch names, commit messages, and pull request descriptions automatically in GitButler.
---

## Getting Started

### Global AI Setup (One-time)

1. Navigate to **Global settings** → **AI Options**
2. Choose your AI provider:
   - **GitButler API** (default): Uses OpenAI through GitButler's servers - no API key needed
   - **Your own key**: Bring your own OpenAI, Claude, Ollama, or LM Studio credentials
3. If using your own key, enter your API credentials

### Per-Project Setup

1. Open **Project settings** → **AI options**
2. Enable **"Enable branch and commit message generation"**
3. Optionally enable **"Enable experimental AI features"** for advanced functionality

## Features

### Branch Name Generation

Automatically creates descriptive, kebab-case branch names based on your code changes.

**Usage:**

- Right-click on a branch header and select **Generate branch name**
- GitButler analyzes commit messages in the branch and suggests an appropriate name
- Generated names use kebab-case format and avoid conflicts with existing branches

### Commit Message Generation

Creates professional commit messages following best practices.

**Features:**

- Semantic prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`)
- 50-character title limit, 72-character body wrap
- Explains what changed and why
- Real-time streaming as AI generates the message
- Based on actual code diffs, not just file names

**Usage:**

1. Make changes to your files (staging is automatic in GitButler)
2. Click the **Generate message** button in the commit message editor
3. AI streams the generated message in real-time
4. Review and edit before committing

**Example format:**

```
feat: add user authentication system

Implements JWT-based authentication with login and registration
endpoints. Includes password hashing and session management
to secure user accounts.
```

### Pull Request Descriptions

Generates comprehensive PR descriptions when creating pull requests.

**Usage:**

1. Create a pull request from your branch
2. In the PR creation dialog, click **Generate PR description**
3. AI analyzes all commits in your branch and generates a description
4. Review and edit the generated content before creating the PR

**Generated content includes:**

- High-level summary based on commit messages
- Structured description following PR templates (if configured)
- Context derived from the changes in your branch

## Advanced Features

### Custom Prompts

- **Global Prompts**: Create custom prompts in **Global settings** → **AI Options**
- **Project-Specific Prompts**: Assign specific prompts per project in **Project settings** → **AI options**
- **Commit & Branch Prompts**: Separate customization for commit messages and branch names

## Configuration

### Global Settings (Global settings → AI Options)

- **AI Provider**: Choose between OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, or LM Studio
- **Key Options**: Use GitButler API or bring your own credentials for each provider
- **Model Selection**: Choose specific models per provider (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, etc.)
- **Amount of provided context**: Set how many characters of git diff to send to AI

### Project Settings (Project settings → AI options)

- **Enable branch and commit message generation**: Master toggle for AI features in this project
- **Enable experimental AI features**: Access to advanced AI functionality (requires GitButler API)
- **Custom prompts**: Assign specific prompts from global settings to this project for commits and branches

## Troubleshooting

**AI features not working?**

1. **Check Global Settings**: Navigate to **Global settings** → **AI Options** and verify:
   - AI provider is configured (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Key option is selected (GitButler API or your own key)
   - If using your own key, ensure it's entered correctly
   - Model is selected for your chosen provider
2. **Check Project Settings**: Open **Project settings** → **AI options** and ensure:
   - **"Enable branch and commit message generation"** is turned ON
   - This setting must be enabled for each project individually
3. **Verify API Access**: Ensure sufficient API quota and valid credentials

**AI buttons not appearing?**

- The project-level toggle in **Project settings** → **AI options** controls button visibility
- Without this enabled, Generate buttons won't appear in the UI

**Need better suggestions?**

- Customize prompt templates in **Global settings** → **AI Options**
- Make meaningful code changes with clear patterns
- Use descriptive variable names and comments in your code
- Review [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.gitbutler.com/troubleshooting/custom-csp) for advanced configurations
