title: Code Agent Assistant

GitButler can also orchestrate your coding agents and help automatically manage, checkpoint and commit the work that they do for you.

<Callout type="info">
  Currently the only supported agent is [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), but we
  are working on more agent support.
</Callout>

You can access our agent management in the by clicking the AI Stars in the upper right corner of the GitButler window:

The code agent assistant can run multiple agents at the same time and will automatically try to assign file edits done by each to a specific branch. So each branch is essentially context for an agent to directly work on.

# Setup

There is some basic setup that may need to be done the first time, if you've never used Claude Code before.

### Installing Claude Code

Before you can use the agents tab, you need to have Claude Code installed as we wrap the SDK that it provides. If we can't find the binary, you should see something like this:

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"
  src="https://gitbutler-docs-images-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/CleanShot%202025-09-05%20at%2014.37.45%402x.png"

  height="600"
  subtitle="Wherefor art thou, Claudius?"
/>

To install Claude Code, you can read through the docs [here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart), but the simple version is to use their "Native Install" method:

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}

<Tabs groupId="platform" items={["macOS and Linux", "Windows PowerShell", "Windows CMD"]} persist>
  <Tab value="macOS and Linux">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Windows PowerShell">
  ```bash
  irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Windows CMD">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del
    install.cmd
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}

You will then need to setup and login to Claude Code, which will require an Anthropic account. You can either connect it to an API key for direct billing or use one of the plans. You can learn more on the [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) page.

<Callout type="info">
  GitButler does not charge you for agent use, but Anthropic does. This goes directly through Claude
  Code usage, we simply help manage the agent.
</Callout>

# Generating Code in the Agents Tab

Once your agent is setup, you can select a branch to work on, type in a prompt and we will run that though Claude Code, same as if you ran it in the terminal.

We will do some cool things as it runs, however.

### Token and Cost Monitoring

Running agents costs money, so we try to keep you reminded of how much you're spending running these models.

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"
  src="https://gitbutler-docs-images-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/CleanShot%202025-09-05%20at%2011.52.08%402x.png"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="Usage overview for the branch - tokens and estimated cost"
/>

These costs are estimates, it may differ if you're running on a plan versus using a metered API token.

### Model Selection

There are a few different models that you can choose from for running your task. You can change your active model in the model selection dialog of the chat box.

  subtitle="You can choose from any of the active Anthropic models"

### Thinking Modes

Claude Code also allows for selection of a "thinking mode". The lower modes are faster, the higher modes tend to take longer and be more expensive, but can produce better results.

  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="CleanShot 2025-09-05 at 11.53.51@2x.png"
/>

### Prompt Templates

If you find that you're using similar prompts over and over, you can easily setup several prompt templates. Selecting one will seed the prompt with the contents of that template.

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"

  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="Prompt templates"
/>

You can also edit your available templates by selecting the "Edit templates" option, which opens up our JSON file in your editor of choice. The templates look something like this:

````json
{
  "templates": [
    {
      "label": "Bug Fix",
      "template": "Please fix the bug in this code:\n\n```\n// Your code here\n```\n\nExpected behavior:\nActual behavior:\nSteps to reproduce:"
    },
    {
      "label": "Code Review",
      "template": "Please review this code for:\n- Performance issues\n- Security vulnerabilities\n- Best practices\n- Code style\n\n```\n// Your code here\n```"
    },
    {
      "label": "Refactor",
      "template": "Please refactor this code to improve:\n- Readability\n- Performance\n- Maintainability\n\n```\n// Your code here\n```\n\nRequirements:"
    },
    {
      "label": "Add Tests",
      "template": "Please write comprehensive tests for this code:\n\n```\n// Your code here\n```\n\nTest cases should cover:\n- Happy path\n- Edge cases\n- Error conditions"
    }
  ]
}
````

### Context Clearing

After a while, your context in a single branch can get long. If you no longer need all the context but want to keep your agent working on the same branch, you can clear it with the "Clear Context" button at the top of the screen.

### Modified Files Listing

As files are assigned and committed to your branch, you can see an overview of the changes made in the sidebar. You can also alt-click on them to open them directly in your editor if you want to make manual changes.
