description: Complete step-by-step tutorial for getting started with GitButler, from importing repositories to managing multiple branches and commits.
---

Here is a quick overview of how to get started with GitButler. In this guide, we will:

- Get setup and start working with a local repository
- Do work and commit on several branches simultaneously
- Push your work to a remote repository and get it integrated
- Reorder and edit your commits
- Undo anything

## Importing a Local Repository

After [downloading](https://app.gitbutler.com/downloads) and installing GitButler, you will be greeted with the welcome screen. From here you can import or clone a repository.

<ImageSection
  alt="Import screen"
  src="/started/welcome-screen.png"
  subtitle="First thing you see when you launch GitButler"
/>

Let's start by importing an existing Git project on your disk. If you click "Add local project" and then choose the directory of the existing Git initialized project, then we will start the import process.

## Choosing a Target Branch

<ImageSection
  alt="Import screen"
  src="/started/import.png"
  subtitle="First step: choose your target branch"
/>

The first step is to choose your "target" branch. GitButler focuses on a trunk based development model, so first you need to tell us what branch means "production" to you. Normally this is something like `origin/master` or `origin/main`.

If you would like to use our AI features like commit message generation, you can also sign up for a GitButler account and log in. This is optional, but we'll do it here so we can show off these features.

You can also connect GitButler to your GitHub account so we can automatically open Pull Requests for you, but this is also optional.

## Set Up Git Authentication

In order to push to a remote repository, you will need to set up your Git authentication. We provide three ways to do this, but generally it's easiest to use the existing Git executable. You can hit the "Test credentials" button to make sure everything is working properly.

  subtitle="Second step: configure your git pushes"

## Ready to Go

Ok, now we're all setup and you should see our main working screen. If you had a branch with some work in progress, you should see it imported already. Otherwise, you will see a blank workspace with no branches applied.

  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="A workspace with no initial branches"
/>

## Do Some Work

Now we can start working. GitButler will watch your working directory and immediately show any changes that you make.

In the above case, we can see that there are some changes to the `README.md` file. Let's create a new branch and commit our changes to it. You can click the "Create Branch" button in the workspace, or the "Commit to new branch" button below the Unassigned changes.

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"
  src="https://gitbutler-docs-images-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/CleanShot%202025-07-02%20at%2010.44.12%402x.png"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="Creating a new branch."
/>

You can click on any file to see what the diff is.

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"
  src="https://gitbutler-docs-images-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/view-file.png"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="view-file.png"
/>

Now that you have a branch, you can simply hit the "Start a Commit" button on the branch you want to commit to, then either write your commit message, or hit "Generate Message" to let AI look at the diffs and write a message for you.

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"
  src="https://gitbutler-docs-images-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/CleanShot%202025-07-02%20at%2010.53.15%402x.png"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="Simple commit message dialog"
/>

Once you've done that, you should see something like this:

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"
  src="https://gitbutler-docs-images-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/post-commit.png"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="Now we can see our one commit on our branch"
/>

## Split secondary work into a new branch

Now let's say that I decide to add a new feature and don't want it to depend on my README change. Instead of stashing my changes and doing that, or committing unrelated work into the branch I'm on, I can simply create a new parallel branch, drag my work over there and commit there.

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"
  src="https://gitbutler-docs-images-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/two-branches.png"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="Now we have two branches, both applied"
/>

Now both branches are applied, but I can commit to them independently and push them to a remote repository at different times.

## Integrate Your Work

Since the README updating branch is ready to be merged, I can push that branch up, open a Pull Request on it and wait for it to be integrated, while I continue to work on and commit to my other feature branch.

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"
  src="https://gitbutler-docs-images-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/integrated2.png"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="One branch is pushed and we can see that it has been integrated upstream."
/>

Now we have a series of commits on our feature branch, which we've continued to work on while we're waiting for our README update to be integrated.

GitButler sees that our target branch has new work and shows us the "Update" button, which we can click to rebase our feature branch on top of the new work and also remove the README branch automatically, since we can see that it has been integrated upstream.

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"
  src="https://gitbutler-docs-images-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/update-base.png"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="Updating from upstream will automatically remove integrated branches and rebase other branches on top of the new work."
/>

## Reorder and Edit Your Commits

GitButler makes it very easy to edit, reorder, squash and split commits. If you hover over any commit, you will see a drag handle on the top right. You can drag the commit to reorder it, or drag it on top of another commit to squash them together.

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"
  src="https://gitbutler-docs-images-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/move-commit.png"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="Drag one commit on top of another to squash, above or below to reorder, or to another branch to move it."
/>

To split a commit, you can insert an "empty" commit in between the two commits you want to split, then drag the changes from the commit you want to split into the empty commit.

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"
  src="https://gitbutler-docs-images-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/add-empty-commit.png"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="Add a new empty commit above or below an existing one"
/>

Now you can drag the changes from the commit you want to split into the new empty commit.

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"
  src="https://gitbutler-docs-images-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/amend-to-empty-commit.png"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="Drag files from one commit to another, in this case, amending the previously empty commit"
/>

Finally, you can edit the commit message of the previously empty commit to give it a meaningful message, and now you have split the original commit into two separate commits.

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"
  src="https://gitbutler-docs-images-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/add-commit-message.png"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="add-commit-message.png"
/>

You can also uncommit any commit without dependencies, or even individual files in a commit.

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"
  src="https://gitbutler-docs-images-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uncommit.png"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="Uncommit any commit"
/>

All of this makes it very easy to build up and maintain a nice, clean history that is easy to understand and work with.

## Unapply a stack

If you decide that you don't want to work on a branch anymore, you can simply unapply it. This will remove all the changes from that branch from your working directory, but keep the branch around in case you want to reapply it later.

<ImageSection
  className="mx-auto"

  width="800"
  height="600"
  subtitle="Unapply a branch to remove those changes from your working directory and save the work"
/>

## Undo Anything

If at any time, you do something that you didn't mean to do, you can always undo it. You can undo a commit, a commit edit, a squash, an upstream update, a branch application, anything.

Just click the "Operations History" button in the sidebar, find the action you want to rewind to and hit the "Revert" button.
