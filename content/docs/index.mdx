## What We Do

The GitButler client is a powerful Git client. You can manage your branches, work on multiple things at once, push and fetch from your Git server, easily rebase and modify commits and more. We have a unique approach to merge conflicts that helps split up any conflicting work. It also keeps a timeline so that you can easily undo any operation.
