description: "Amends changes into the appropriate commits where they belong."
---

Amends changes into the appropriate commits where they belong.

The semantic for finding "the appropriate commit" is as follows:

- Changes are amended into the topmost commit of the leftmost (first) lane (branch)
- If a change is assigned to a particular lane (branch), it will be amended into a commit there
- If there are no commits in this branch, a new commit is created
- If a change has a dependency to a particular commit, it will be amended into that particular commit

Optionally an identifier to an Uncommitted File or a Branch (stack) may be provided.

- If an Uncommitted File id is provided, absorb will be peformed for just that file
- If a Branch (stack) id is provided, absorb will be performed for all changes assigned to that stack
- If no source is provided, absorb is performed for all uncommitted changes

**Usage:** `but absorb [SOURCE]`

## Arguments

* `<SOURCE>` — If the Source is an uncommitted change - the change will be absorbed. If the Source is a stack - anything assigned to the stack will be absorbed accordingly. If not provided, everything that is uncommitted will be absorbed
