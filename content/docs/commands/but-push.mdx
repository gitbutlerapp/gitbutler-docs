Push changes in a branch to remote.

but push will update the remote with the latest commits from the specified branch.

Whatever the upstream remote is configured for the base branch, that will be used as the remote to push to.

If you have another remote you want to push to that is different from the target remote (for example, a fork of an open source project), you can set it in the GitButler project settings. (Currently only via the GUI.)

**Usage:** `but push <BRANCH_ID> [OPTIONS]`

## Arguments

* `<BRANCH_ID>` — Branch name or CLI ID to push (required)

## Options

* `-f`, `--with-force` — Force push even if it's not fast-forward (default: `true`)
* `-s`, `--skip-force-push-protection` — Skip force push protection checks
* `-r`, `--run-hooks` — Run pre-push hooks (default: `true`)
