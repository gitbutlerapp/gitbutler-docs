# Commands for managing branches.

Commands for managing branches.

This includes creating, deleting, listing, showing details about, and applying and unapplying branches.

By default without a subcommand, it will list the branches.

**Usage:** `but branch <COMMAND>`

## Subcommands

### `but branch new`

Creates a new branch in the workspace

If no branch name is provided, a new parallel branch with a generated
name will be created.

You can also specify an anchor point using the `--anchor` option,
which can be either a commit ID or an existing branch name to create
the new branch from. This allows you to create stacked branches.

**Usage:** `but branch new [BRANCH_NAME] [OPTIONS]`

**Arguments:**

* `<BRANCH_NAME>` — Name of the new branch

**Options:**

* `-a`, `--anchor` `<ANCHOR>` — Anchor point - either a commit ID or branch name to create the new branch from

### `but branch delete`

Deletes a branch from the workspace

This will remove the branch and all its commits from the workspace.
If the branch has unpushed commits, you will be prompted for confirmation
unless the `--force` flag is used.

**Usage:** `but branch delete <BRANCH_NAME> [OPTIONS]`

**Arguments:**

* `<BRANCH_NAME>` — Name of the branch to delete (required)

**Options:**

* `-f`, `--force` — Force deletion without confirmation

### `but branch list`

List the branches in the repository

By default, shows the active branch and the 20 most recently updated branches.

You can use the `--all` flag to show all branches, `--local` to show only
local branches, or `--remote` to show only remote branches.

You can also filter branch names by specifying a substring, such as
`but branch list feature` to show only branches with "feature" in the name.

If you want to check for review status, you can add `--review` to fetch
and display pull request or merge request information for each branch.
This will make the command slower as it needs to query the forge.

By default, the command checks if each branch merges cleanly into
the *upstream base target branch* (not your workspace).
You can disable this check with `--no-check` to make the command faster.

By default it also calculates the number of commits each branch is ahead
of the base branch. You can disable this with `--no-ahead` to
make the command faster.

**Usage:** `but branch list [FILTER] [OPTIONS]`

**Arguments:**

* `<FILTER>` — Filter branches by name (case-insensitive substring match)

**Options:**

* `-l`, `--local` — Show only local branches
* `-r`, `--remote` — Show only remote branches
* `-a`, `--all` — Show all branches (not just active + 20 most recent)
* `--no-ahead` — Don't calculate and show number of commits ahead of base (faster)
* `--review` — Fetch and display review information (PRs, MRs, etc.)
* `--no-check` — Don't check if each branch merges cleanly into upstream

### `but branch show`

Show commits ahead of base for a specific branch

This shows the list of commits that are on the specified branch but not yet integrated into the base target branch.

You can also choose to fetch and display review information, show files modified in each commit with line counts, generate an AI summary of the branch changes, and check if the branch merges cleanly into upstream.

**Usage:** `but branch show <BRANCH_ID> [OPTIONS]`

**Arguments:**

* `<BRANCH_ID>` — CLI ID or name of the branch to show (required)

**Options:**

* `-r`, `--review` — Fetch and display review information
* `-f`, `--files` — Show files modified in each commit with line counts
* `--ai` — Generate AI summary of the branch changes
* `--check` — Check if the branch merges cleanly into upstream and identify conflicting commits

### `but branch apply`

Apply a branch to the workspace

If you want to apply an unapplied branch to your workspace so you
can work on it, you can run `but branch apply <branch-name>`.

This will apply the changes in that branch into your working directory
as a parallel applied branch.

**Usage:** `but branch apply <BRANCH_NAME>`

**Arguments:**

* `<BRANCH_NAME>` — Name of the branch to apply (required)

### `but branch unapply`

Unapply a branch from the workspace

If you want to unapply an applied branch from your workspace
(effectively stashing it) so you can work on other branches,
you can run `but branch unapply <branch-name>`.

This will remove the changes in that branch from your working
directory and you can re-apply it later when needed. You will then
see the branch as unapplied in `but branch list`.

**Usage:** `but branch unapply <BRANCH_NAME> [OPTIONS]`

**Arguments:**

* `<BRANCH_NAME>` — Name of the branch to unapply (required)

**Options:**

* `-f`, `--force` — Force unapply without confirmation
