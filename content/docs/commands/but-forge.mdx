Commands for interacting with forges like GitHub, GitLab (coming soon), etc.

The but forge tools allow you to authenticate with a forge from the CLI, which then enables features like creating pull requests with the but review commands.

Start by running but forge auth to authenticate with your forge.

You can also authenticate several different users on a forge and see them listed with but forge list-users or forget a user with but forge forget.

Currently only GitHub is supported, but more forges will be added in the near future.

**Usage:** `but forge <COMMAND>`

## Subcommands

### `but forge auth`

Authenticate with your forge provider (at the moment, only GitHub is supported)

**Usage:** `but forge auth`

### `but forge list-users`

List authenticated forge accounts known to GitButler

**Usage:** `but forge list-users`

### `but forge forget`

Forget a previously authenticated forge account

**Usage:** `but forge forget [USERNAME]`

**Arguments:**

* `<USERNAME>` — The username of the forge account to forget If not provided, you'll be prompted to select which account(s) to forget. If only one account exists, it will be forgotten automatically
