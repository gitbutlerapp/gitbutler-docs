title: "`but resolve`"
description: "Resolve conflicts in a commit."
---

When a commit is in a conflicted state (marked with conflicts during rebase),
use this command to enter resolution mode, resolve the conflicts, and finalize.

## Workflow

1. Enter resolution mode: `but resolve <commit-id>`
2. Resolve conflicts in your editor (remove conflict markers)
3. Check remaining conflicts: `but resolve status`
4. Finalize resolution: `but resolve finish`
   Or cancel: `but resolve cancel`

When in resolution mode, `but status` will also show that you're resolving conflicts.

**Usage:** `but resolve <COMMAND> [COMMIT]`

## Subcommands

### `but resolve status`

Show the status of conflict resolution, listing remaining conflicted files

**Usage:** `but resolve status`

### `but resolve finish`

Finalize conflict resolution and return to workspace mode.

This commits the resolved changes, rebases any commits on top of the resolved commit, and returns to the normal workspace.

**Usage:** `but resolve finish`

### `but resolve cancel`

Cancel conflict resolution and return to workspace mode.

This discards all changes made during resolution and restores the workspace to its pre-resolution state.

**Usage:** `but resolve cancel`
