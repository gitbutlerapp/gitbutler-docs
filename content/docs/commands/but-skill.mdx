# Manage Claude AI skills for GitButler.

Manage Claude AI skills for GitButler.

Skills provide enhanced AI capabilities for working with GitButler through
Claude Code and other AI assistants.

Use `but skill install` to install the GitButler skill files into your
repository or globally.

## Examples

Install the skill in the current repository:

```text
but skill install
```

Install the skill globally:

```text
but skill install --global
```

**Usage:** `but skill <COMMAND>`

## Subcommands

### `but skill install`

Install the GitButler CLI skill files for Coding agents

By default, installs the skill into the current repository. The command will prompt you to select a skill folder format (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf) unless you specify a custom path with --path.

Use --global to install the skill in a global location instead of the current repository.

Examples

Install in current repository (prompts for format):

  but skill install

Install globally (prompts for format):

  but skill install --global

Install to a custom path:

  but skill install --path .claude/skills/gitbutler

Auto-detect installation location (update existing installation):

  but skill install --detect


**Usage:** `but skill install [OPTIONS]`

**Options:**

* `-g`, `--global` — Install the skill globally instead of in the current repository
* `-p`, `--path` `<PATH>` — Custom path where to install the skill (relative to repository root or absolute)
* `-d`, `--detect` — Automatically detect where to install by finding existing installation

### `but skill check`

Check if installed GitButler skills are up to date with the CLI version

Scans for installed skill files and compares their version with the current CLI version. By default, checks both local (repository) and global installations.

Examples

Check all installed skills:

  but skill check

Check and automatically update outdated skills:

  but skill check --update

Check only global installations:

  but skill check --global


**Usage:** `but skill check [OPTIONS]`

**Options:**

* `-g`, `--global` — Only check global installations (in home directory)
* `-l`, `--local` — Only check local installations (in current repository)
* `-u`, `--update` — Automatically update any outdated skills found
