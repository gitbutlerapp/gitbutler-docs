# Unapply a branch from the workspace.

Unapply a branch from the workspace.

If you want to unapply an applied branch from your workspace (effectively stashing it) so you can work on other branches, you can run but unapply `<branch>`.

This will remove the changes in that branch from your working directory and you can re-apply it later when needed. You will then see the branch as unapplied in but branch list.

You can specify the branch by:

- CLI ID from but status (e.g., bu)
- Full branch name (e.g., feature-branch)

If no branch is specified, an interactive list will be shown to choose from.

**Usage:** `but unapply [BRANCH] [OPTIONS]`

## Arguments

* `<BRANCH>` — Branch to unapply (CLI ID or full name)

## Options

* `-f`, `--force` — Force unapply without confirmation
