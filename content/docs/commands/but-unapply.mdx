title: "`but unapply`"
description: "Unapply a branch from the workspace."
---

If you want to unapply an applied branch from your workspace
(effectively stashing it) so you can work on other branches,
you can run `but unapply <branch-name>`.

This will remove the changes in that branch from your working
directory and you can re-apply it later when needed. You will then
see the branch as unapplied in `but branch list`.

The identifier can be:
- A CLI ID pointing to a stack or branch (e.g., "bu" from `but status`)
- A branch name

If a branch name (or an identifier pointing to a branch) is provided,
the entire stack containing that branch will be unapplied.

## Examples

Unapply by branch name:

```text
but unapply my-feature-branch
```

Unapply by CLI ID:

```text
but unapply bu
```

**Usage:** `but unapply <IDENTIFIER> [OPTIONS]`

## Arguments

* `<IDENTIFIER>` — CLI ID or name of the branch/stack to unapply (required)

## Options

* `-f`, `--force` — Force unapply without confirmation
