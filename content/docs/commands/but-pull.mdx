# Updates all applied branches to be up to date with the target branch.

Updates all applied branches to be up to date with the target branch.

This fetches the latest changes from the remote and rebases all applied branches on top of the updated target branch.

You should run this regularly to keep your branches up to date with the latest changes from the main development line.

You can run but pull --check first to see if your branches can be cleanly merged into the target branch before running the update.

**Usage:** `but pull [OPTIONS]`

## Options

* `-c`, `--check` — Only check the status without updating (equivalent to the old but base check)
