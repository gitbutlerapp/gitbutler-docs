Insert a blank commit before the specified commit, or at the top of a stack.

This is useful for creating a placeholder commit that you can then amend changes into later using but mark, but rub or but absorb.

You can modify the empty commit message at any time using but describe.

This allows for a more Jujutsu style workflow where you create commits first and then fill them in as you work. Create an empty commit, mark it for auto-commit, and then just work on your changes. Write the commit message whenever you prefer.

**Usage:** `but new <TARGET>`

## Arguments

* `<TARGET>` — Commit ID to insert before, or branch ID to insert at top of stack (required)
