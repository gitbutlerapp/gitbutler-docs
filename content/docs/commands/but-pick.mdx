# Cherry-pick a commit from an unapplied branch into an applied virtual branch.

Cherry-pick a commit from an unapplied branch into an applied virtual branch.

This command allows you to pick individual commits from unapplied branches
and apply them to your current workspace branches.

The source can be:
- A commit SHA (full or short)
- A CLI ID (e.g., "c5" from `but status`)
- An unapplied branch name (shows interactive commit selection)

If no target branch is specified:
- In interactive mode: prompts you to select a target branch
- If only one branch exists: automatically uses that branch
- In non-interactive mode: fails with an error

## Examples

Pick a specific commit into a branch:

```text
but pick abc1234 my-feature
```

Pick using a CLI ID:

```text
but pick c5 my-feature
```

Interactively select commits from an unapplied branch:

```text
but pick feature-branch
```

**Usage:** `but pick <SOURCE> [TARGET_BRANCH]`

## Arguments

* `<SOURCE>` — The commit SHA, CLI ID, or unapplied branch name to cherry-pick from (required)
* `<TARGET_BRANCH>` — The target virtual branch to apply the commit(s) to
