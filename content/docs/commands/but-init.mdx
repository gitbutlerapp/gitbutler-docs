Initializes a GitButler project from a git repository in the current directory.

If you have an existing Git repository and want to start using GitButler with it, you can run this command to set up the necessary configuration and data structures.

This is automatically run when you run any other but command in a git repository that is not yet initialized with GitButler.

Note: Currently, if there is no Git repository already, you will need to initialize it with git init and add a remote first, as GitButler needs a remote to base the branches on.

We are working on removing this limitation, but for now this is something to be aware of.

**Usage:** `but init [OPTIONS]`

## Options

* `-r`, `--repo` — Also initializes a git repository in the current directory if one does not exist
