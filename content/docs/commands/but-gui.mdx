Open the GitButler GUI for the current project.

Running but gui will launch the GitButler graphical user interface in the current directory's GitButler project.

This provides a visual way to manage branches, commits, and uncommitted changes, complementing the command-line interface.

You can also just run but . as a shorthand to open the GUI.

**Usage:** `but gui`
