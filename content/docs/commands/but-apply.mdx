If you want to apply an unapplied branch to your workspace so you
can work on it, you can run `but apply <branch-name>`.

This will apply the changes in that branch into your working directory
as a parallel applied branch.

## Examples

Apply by branch name:

```text
but apply my-feature-branch
```

**Usage:** `but apply <BRANCH_NAME>`

## Arguments

* `<BRANCH_NAME>` — Name of the branch to apply (required)
