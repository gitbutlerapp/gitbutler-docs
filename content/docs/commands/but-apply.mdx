# Apply a branch to the workspace.

Apply a branch to the workspace.

If you want to apply an unapplied branch to your workspace so you can work on it, you can run but apply `<branch>`.

This will apply the changes in that branch into your working directory as a parallel applied branch.

You can specify the branch by:

- CLI ID from but status (e.g., bu)
- Short ID from but branch list (e.g., 00)
- Full branch name (e.g., feature-branch)

If no branch is specified, an interactive list will be shown to choose from.

**Usage:** `but apply [BRANCH]`

## Arguments

* `<BRANCH>` — Branch to apply (CLI ID, short ID from list, or full name)
