# Merge a branch into your local target branch.

Merge a branch into your local target branch.

If the target branch is local (gb-local), finds the local branch that the target references (e.g., gb-local/master becomes master) and merges the specified branch into that local branch. After merging, runs the equivalent of but pull to update all branches.

Examples

Merge a branch by its CLI ID:

  but merge bu

Merge a branch by name:

  but merge my-feature-branch


**Usage:** `but merge <BRANCH>`

## Arguments

* `<BRANCH>` — Branch ID or name to merge (required)
