Commands for managing the base target branch.

Every branch managed by GitButler is based off a common base branch on your remote repository (usually origin/main or origin/master). This is the target branch that all changes will eventually be integrated into.

The base subcommand allows you to manage and update this base branch.

When you run but base update, GitButler will fetch the latest changes from the remote and rebase all your applied branches on top of the updated base branch. You will want to do this regularly to keep your branches up to date with the latest changes from the main development line.

You can also use but base check to verify that your branches can be cleanly merged into the base branch without conflicts and see what work is upstream an not yet integrated into your branches.

**Usage:** `but base <COMMAND>`

## Subcommands

### `but base check`

Fetches from the remote and checks the mergeability of the branches in the workspace.

This will see if the target branch has had new work merged into it, and if so, it will check if each branch in the workspace can be cleanly merged into the updated target branch.

It will also show what work is upstream that has not yet been integrated into the branches.

**Usage:** `but base check`

### `but base update`

Updates all applied branches to be up to date with the target branch

This fetches the latest changes from the remote and rebases all applied branches on top of the updated target branch.

You should run this regularly to keep your branches up to date with the latest changes from the main development line.

You can run but base check first to see if your branches can be cleanly merged into the target branch before running the update.

**Usage:** `but base update`
