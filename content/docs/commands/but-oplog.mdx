# Commands for viewing and managing operation history.

Commands for viewing and managing operation history.

Displays a list of past operations performed in the repository,
including their timestamps and descriptions.

This allows you to restore to any previous point in the history of the
project. All state is preserved in operations, including uncommitted changes.

You can use `but oplog restore <oplog-sha>` to restore to a specific state.

By default, shows the last 20 oplog entries (same as `but oplog list`).

**Usage:** `but oplog <COMMAND>`

which you can find by running `but oplog` or `but oplog list`.
