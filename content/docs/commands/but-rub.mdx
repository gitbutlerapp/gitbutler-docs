The `rub` command is a simple verb that helps you do a number of editing
operations by doing combinations of two things.

For example, you can "rub" a file onto a branch to stage that file to
the branch. You can also "rub" a commit onto another commit to squash
them together. You can rub a commit onto a branch to move that commit.
You can rub a file from one commit to another.

Non-exhaustive list of operations:

```text
      │Source     │Target
──────┼───────────┼──────
Amend │File,Branch│Commit

Move  │Commit     │Branch
```
