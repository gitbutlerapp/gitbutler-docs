Combines two entities together to perform an operation.

The rub command is a simple verb that helps you do a number of editing operations by doing combinations of two things.

For example, you can "rub" a file onto a branch to assign that file to the branch. You can also "rub" a commit onto another commit to squash them together. You can rub a commit onto a branch to move that commit. You can rub a file from one commit to another.
