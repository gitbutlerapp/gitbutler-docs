# Overview of the project workspace state.

Overview of the project workspace state.

This shows unstaged files, files staged to stacks, all applied branches (stacked or parallel), commits on each of those branches, upstream commits that are unintegrated, commit status (pushed or local), and base branch information.

Examples

Normal usage:

  but status

Shorthand with listing files modified

  but status -f


**Usage:** `but status [OPTIONS]`

## Options

* `-f` — Determines whether the committed files should be shown as well (default: `false`)
* `-v`, `--verbose` — Show verbose output with commit author and timestamp (default: `false`)
* `-r`, `--refresh-prs` — Forces a sync of pull requests from the forge before showing status (default: `false`)
* `-u`, `--upstream` — Show detailed list of upstream commits that haven't been integrated yet (default: `false`)
* `--no-hint` — Disable hints about available commands at the end of output (default: `false`)
