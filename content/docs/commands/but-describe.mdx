Edit the commit message of the specified commit.

You can easily change the commit message of any of your commits by running but describe `<commit-id>` and providing a new message in the editor.

This will rewrite the commit with the new message and then rebase any dependent commits on top of it.

You can also use but describe `<branch-id>` to rename the branch.

**Usage:** `but describe <TARGET>`

## Arguments

* `<TARGET>` — Commit ID to edit the message for, or branch ID to rename (required)
