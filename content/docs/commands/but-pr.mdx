title: "`but pr`"
description: "Commands for creating and managing pull requests on a forge."
---

If you are authenticated with a forge using but config forge auth, you can use the but pr commands to create pull requests (or merge requests) on the remote repository for your branches.

Running but pr without a subcommand defaults to but pr new, which will prompt you to select a branch to create a PR for.

**Usage:** `but pr <COMMAND>`

## Subcommands

### `but pr new`

Create a new pull request for a branch. If no branch is specified, you will be prompted to select one. If there is only one branch without a PR, you will be asked to confirm

**Usage:** `but pr new [BRANCH] [OPTIONS]`

**Arguments:**

* `<BRANCH>` — The branch to create a PR for

**Options:**

* `-m`, `--message` `<MESSAGE>` — PR title and description. The first line is the title, the rest is the description
* `-F`, `--file` `<FILE>` — Read PR title and description from file. The first line is the title, the rest is the description
* `-f`, `--with-force` — Force push even if it's not fast-forward (defaults to true) (default: `true`)
