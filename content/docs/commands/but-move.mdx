# Move a commit to a different location in the stack.

Move a commit to a different location in the stack.

By default, commits are moved to be before (below) the target. Use `--after` to move the commit after (above) the target instead.

When moving to a branch, the commit is placed at the top of that branch's stack.

## Examples

Move a commit before another commit:

```bash
but move abc123 def456
```

Move a commit after another commit:

```bash
but move abc123 def456 --after
```

Move a commit to a different branch (places at top):

```bash
but move abc123 my-feature-branch
```

**Usage:** `but move [OPTIONS] <SOURCE_COMMIT> <TARGET>`

## Arguments

* `<SOURCE_COMMIT>` — Commit ID to move
* `<TARGET>` — Target commit ID or branch name

## Options

* `-a`, `--after` — Move the commit after (above) the target instead of before (below)
* `-j`, `--json` — Whether to use JSON output format
