title: "`but move`"
description: "Move a commit to a different location in the stack."
---

By default, commits are moved to be before (below) the target.
Use `--after` to move the commit after (above) the target instead.

When moving to a branch, the commit is placed at the top of that branch's stack.

## Examples

Move a commit before another commit:

```text
but move abc123 def456
```

Move a commit after another commit:

```text
but move abc123 def456 --after
```

Move a commit to a different branch (places at top):

```text
but move abc123 my-feature-branch
```

**Usage:** `but move <SOURCE_COMMIT> <TARGET> [OPTIONS]`

## Arguments

* `<SOURCE_COMMIT>` — Commit ID to move (required)
* `<TARGET>` — Target commit ID or branch name (required)

## Options

* `-a`, `--after` — Move the commit after (above) the target instead of before (below)
