{/* NEW_RELEASE */}

## 0.12.9
#### New
- Un-applying a virtual branch will now create a regular branch - this makes it easier to switch back and forth between using gitbutler and the git cli
- Improves secrets handling - the app will now use the OS-specific secure store (credential manager)
- Removes the git authentication flow using an ssh key generated by the app, in favor of the default fork-exec-ing to the system git binary

#### Windows:
- Fixes Windows specific  bug where in some cases prompting for ssh passwords doesn't work

#### Linux:
- Fixes a Linux-specific regression in 0.12.7 that was making the UI unresponsive
- The app is now also bundled as an RPM for Linux users who use Fedora/CentOS-style distributions

#### Fixes:
- Fixes a bug with incorrectly detecting Git repositories as GitHub ones
- Fixes issues related to reporting of the CI status on branches with pull requests
- Fixes a bug where missing remote branch is not handled gracefully
- Fixes an issue where the app creates more log files than the limit of 14
- Updated the application log format to GitButler.\<date>.log

#### UI:
- Drag and drop of changes and commits has an updated UI, making it easier to see the drop targets
- Fixes a UI bug in the "Push" button where in some cases it was showing an incorrect label
- Fixes a UI bug where the project selector has projects with long names overflowing
- UI: Select components will now be searchable (e.g. long list of branches to select from)
- UI: Updated programming language icons used on files
